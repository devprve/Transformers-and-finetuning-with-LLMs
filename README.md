The complete code for NanoGPT in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX does the following:

Creates a NanoGPT model. The model consists of an embedding layer, a transformer encoder, and a linear layer. The embedding layer converts the input tokens into vectors of a fixed dimension. The transformer encoder is a stack of self-attention layers that learn long-range dependencies in the input sequence. The linear layer projects the output of the transformer encoder to the vocabulary size, predicting the next token in the sequence.
Trains the NanoGPT model. The model is trained using a supervised learning approach. The training data consists of pairs of input sequences and target sequences. The model is trained to predict the next token in the target sequence, given the input sequence.
Generates text from the NanoGPT model. To generate text from the model, a prompt is provided to the model. The model then generates a sequence of tokens, one by one, until a stop token is generated. The probability of generating each token is determined by the model's weights.


Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

Creating the NanoGPT model:

Embedding layer: The embedding layer is a simple lookup table that converts each token in the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimension. This dimension is typically known as the embedding dimension. The embedding dimension is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to improve the performance of the model.
Transformer encoder: The transformer encoder is a stack of self-attention layers. Each self-attention layer learns long-range dependencies in the input sequence by attending to different parts of the sequence. The number of self-attention layers is also a hyperparameter that can be tuned.
Linear layer: The linear layer projects the output of the transformer encoder to the vocabulary size. This layer predicts the next token in the target sequence.
Training the NanoGPT model:

The NanoGPT model is trained using a supervised learning approach. The training data consists of pairs of input sequences and target sequences. The input sequence is the sequence of tokens that the model is given to generate the target sequence. The target sequence is the sequence of tokens that the model is trying to predict.

To train the model, the following steps are performed:

The model is given an input sequence.
The model generates a target sequence.
The predicted target sequence is compared to the actual target sequence.
The model's weights are updated to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual target sequences.
This process is repeated for many iterations until the model learns to generate target sequences that are similar to the actual target sequences in the training data.

Generating text from the NanoGPT model:

To generate text from the NanoGPT model, a prompt is provided to the model. The model then generates a sequence of tokens, one by one, until a stop token is generated. The probability of generating each token is determined by the model's weights.

The following steps are performed to generate text from the NanoGPT model:

The model is given a prompt.
The model generates a token.
The model updates its weights based on the generated token.
The model repeats steps 2 and 3 until a stop token is generated.
The generated sequence of tokens is the output of the model.
